                        <p>Members Armando, Franco and Mario of the Sabalo Country Occult Club gathered at Mazatlan's El Faro Hill to witness the Black Star of June appearance on March 12 at approximately 06:00 a.m. Contrary to popular belief, the Black Star of June phenomenon can appear at any time of the year; lasting an average time of two hours and fifteen minutes, according to previous records of the club. The members at present took photographs of the phenomenon using wide spectrum cameras, with the intention of documenting its physical appearance for the club's archives.</p>

                            <p>Members from different generations of the Sabalo Country Occult Club were reunited on the first day or March at the school's library at 03:00 p.m. to gather and analyze literary material regarding the topic of unexplained phenomena recorded within the city. Students David and Salma were responsible for guiding and advising the new club members on following the standardized format to document secondary information into the club's archives, as well as identifying reliable sources of information from both printed and online media. Their findings will be discussed at a later date at the club's base of operations.</p>
